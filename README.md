### When to use Type or Interface

https://blog.bitsrc.io/type-vs-interface-in-typescript-cf3c00bc04ae

Use interfaces when:

A new object or an object method needs to be defined.
You wish to benefit from declaration merging.

Use types when:

You need to define a primitive-type alias
Defining tuple types
Defining a union
You must create functions and attempt to overload them in object types through composition.
Requiring the use of mapped types
